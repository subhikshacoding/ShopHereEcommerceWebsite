            <p>An e-commerce website is one that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, 
                and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through
                 an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping 
                 and logistics, and provide customer service.he e-commerce trend is gaining major popularity 
                 even in tier-2 and tier-3 cities as they now make up nearly half of all shoppers and contribute 
                 three of every five orders for leading e-retail platforms.</p>

                 For customers, ecommerce makes it possible to shop from anywhere, any time. That means buyers 
                 can get the products they want and need faster without being constrained by operating hours of
                  a traditional brick-and-mortar store.
